# Trippy

The name 'Trippy' here is used as a metaphor to seeing what's always been there in reality in a multitude of new ways. Patterns emerge in everything when the brain emphasizes what it used to ignore. A state when reality becomes exaggerated to a staggering degree.

Ok, I borrowed this perspective from Mark Manson. : )

Recording my tfp practices here. <br>

TensorFlow Probability has been designed with three goals in mind:

  1.  FAST. The team have set out to ensure that tfp is computationally fast and memory-efficient. In essence they are bringing Google's engineering expertise to the world of probabilistic modelling.
  2.  Numerical stability. 
  3.  Idiomatic. The team argue that tfp code "reads naturally". 

I really don't know what these mean at this point. Going to understand what these mean in reality by experiencing the tfp realm.
