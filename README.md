# Trippy

Trippy is a metaphor to how someone feel when they are on acid. 
It's about perception and perspective. We do not see large things that are not there. We see what's always been there in reality in a multitude of new ways. Pattern emerge in everything when the brain emphasizes what it used to ignore. Reality becomes exaggerated to a staggering degree.

Ok, I didn't write that. I borrowed this perspective from Mark Manson. Let me get trippy in the world of tfp now. :)

Recording my tfp practices here. <br>

TensorFlow Probability has been designed with three goals in mind:

  1.  FAST. The team have set out to ensure that tfp is computationally fast and memory-efficient. In essence they are bringing Google's engineering expertise to the world of probabilistic modelling.
  2.  Numerical stability. 
  3.  Idiomatic. The team argue that tfp code "reads naturally". 

I really don't know what these mean at this point. Going to understand what these mean in reality by experiencing the tfp realm.
